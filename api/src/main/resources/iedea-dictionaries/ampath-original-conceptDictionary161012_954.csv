If her menstrual periods are regular and ovulation occurs on day 14 of her cycle, conception takes place about 2 weeks after her LMP. A woman is therefore considered to be 6 weeks pregnant 2 weeks after her first missed period. 

A woman's obstetric date is different from the embryologic date (the age of the embryo). The obstetric date is about 2 weeks longer than the embryologic date.

2167,"VACUUM-ASSISTED BIRTH","This method of helping a baby out of the birth canal was developed as a gentler alternative to forceps. Vacuum-assisted birth can only be used after the cervix is fully dilated (expanded), and the head of the fetus has begun to descend through the pelvis. In this procedure, the doctor uses a device called a vacuum extractor, placing a large rubber or plastic cup against the baby's head. A pump creates suction that gently pulls on the cup to ease the baby down the birth canal. The force of the suction may cause a bruise on the baby's head, but it fades away in a day or so.","VACUUM-ASSISTED BIRTH","","","Procedure","N/A","","Ada Yeung"

8167,"INTERNATIONAL NORMALIZED RATIO","The INR is a way of measuring how fast blood clots. During the test, a sample of blood is taken and a chemical is added to it. The chemical starts a chain of chemical reactions that should make the blood in the sample clot (thicken). During the clotting process, a protein in the blood (prothrombin) turns into an enzyme called thrombin. The time that it takes the prothrombin to turn into thrombin is called the prothrombin time (PT). This is measured in seconds. The PT is compared with the PT of someone who is not taking warfarin to get the INR value.
